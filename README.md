# Optical Flow Detection using Lucas-Kanade Method

This project implements the **Lucas-Kanade** method to detect and track optical flow in a video using Python and OpenCV. Optical flow refers to the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and the scene.

## üîç What is Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow?

The **Lucas-Kanade** method is a differential technique for optical flow estimation. It assumes that the flow is essentially constant in a local neighborhood of the pixel under consideration. It works well for small and consistent motion between frames.
